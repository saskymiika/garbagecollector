Green block is our "character" which can be moved around with w,a,s,d keys. The red blocks represent enemies, which are following the path towards the player.

A block points to the direction that leads to the player. The enemy blindly follows the direction of its current block.

Black blocks are walls. You can add or remove walls with right click.
